# IES-Modelica-Models
This repository contains the files to model and simulate different IES configurations with modes of control. 
The model simulations have been used to produce "Modeling and control of nuclearâ€“renewable integrated energy systems: Dynamic system model for green electricity and hydrogen production" in Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy.
The package has dependencies: Hybrid/NHES, TRANSFORM, WindPowerPlants, PhotoVoltaics.
